# Data Language (ALPHA)

*ATTENTION: This is the ALPHA release. Still many changes to come!*

After many years working with data driven projects i came to love and hate XML and JSON for its great possibilities, 
but for the lack of good ways to make sure the data is valid and consistent.

With Data Language (DL) i want to close that gap.

The Data Language is designed to allow complex data driven projects to be more successful.
Its simple syntax is close to JSON. But DL also provides extensible language constructs for types, enums, annotations and pragmas.
It also allows you to modularize.
More explanations will come in future.

Data Language provides a new state "loadTime" in your application life cycle (develop, compile, deploy, run). 
This allows you to easily make sure that just validated and consistent data enters your application.
The possibilities range much further than any JSON schema can provide.

Have a great day!
